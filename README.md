 // Exercise 
Advice APP builder

 // Brief Description of what you did. 
I created an App that fetches random advice quotes from the Advice Slip API. I built the App using React components. I also added favicon, and an animated loading dot to enhance the user experience when fetching new advice.

 // Peer Review: Karen Cadavos
 Looks on point! I love the small detail such as the ... element when waiting for the advice to load.
  A few suggestions: 
    - center the card to the middle of the screen instead of it being on top of the screen
    - change to hand cursor when hovering on the dice button
